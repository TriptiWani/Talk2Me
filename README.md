# **Talk2Me**
We all love to share our thoughts,photos,locations,etc. with our friends..So here it is!!

This is my Final Project on web-based group chat application **Inventory Management** as part of my Web Development Immersive 15 with General Assembly.

## Duration:
A week

## Tech Stack:
- HTML
- JavaScript
- CSS
- jQuery
- Ruby 2.2.4
- Rails 5
- Cloudinary
- BootStrap
- bcrypt
- httparty
- Heroku
- Gifshot.js
- GoogleMaps.js
- jQueryAutoComplete.js

## Features:

##### Sign Up as a new user
##### Create a new group, add existing app users as members to the group
##### Access related - adding members, editing the group
##### Share your photos, gifs, location along with the normal text chat feature
##### Delete the existing user/group, if user wishes to:
This will just inactivate the account, so that a group/user can come to life again easily!


## Nice to have:
Below listed are the features I would like to implement further to this:
- Chats between two users only
- Display status for each user - DONE
- Camera preview for photos,gifs
- Detect when the user is typing
- Password reset via mailer
- Code refactoring: The code looks bulky. Could be improved
